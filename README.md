### Abstract
We propose to rented home system with java script technology for users. User can search rented home in various places like district wise and local area wise With the current paradigm shift in technological field, there is an urgent need to embrace and appreciate the power of technology. Housing sector remains vigilant to face the challenges of change by employing a new strategy that facilitates easy management of rental houses. 
Distance vector routing protocols have been widely adopted as an efficient routing mechanism in current Internet, and many wireless networks. However, as is well-known, the existing distance vector routing protocols are insecure as it lacks of effective authorization mechanisms and routing updates aggregated from other routers. As a result, the network routing based attacks become a critical issue which could lead to a more deteriorate performance than other general network attacks. Hence there is need to develop a rental house management system that can simplify work for the rental managers so that all their work can be efficient and effective. To get information about how rental houses are currently being managed, the user input values and submitted to server. the server manage the number of rental house information.

## Technology Stack

### HTML

HTML is a standardised system for tagging text files that creates the structure for just about every page that we find and use on the web. It’s HTML that adds in page breaks, paragraphs, bold lettering, italics, and more. HTML works to build this structure by using tags that tell browsers what to do with text. 


### CSS

CSS is used for defining the styles for web pages. It describes the look and formatting of a document which is written in a markup language. It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally used with HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces.

### JAVASCRIPT
JavaScript is a light-weight object-oriented programming language that is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language. JavaScript enables dynamic interactivity on websites when it is applied to an HTML document. It helps the users to build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. JavaScript is commonly used to dynamically modify  and CSS
to update a user interface by the DOM API. It is mainly used in web applications.

### REACT NATIVE

It is used to develop applications for Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web, Windows and UWP by enabling developers to use the React framework along with native platform capabilities. It is also being used to develop virtual reality applications at Oculus.

### Tail Wind CSS

Tailwind CSS makes it quicker to write and maintain the code of your application. By using this utility-first framework, you don't have to write custom CSS to style your application. Instead, you can use utility classes to control the padding, margin, color, font, shadow, and more of your application.
MongoDB

### MongoDB is built on a scale-out architecture that has become popular with developers of all kinds for developing scalable applications with evolving data schemas. As a document database, MongoDB makes it easy for developers to store structured or unstructured data. It uses a JSON-like format to store documents.

### Node.JS

Node. js is widely used for the back-end of applications, like using Express. js to build the back-end of classic web applications. Also, it is used for server-side programming and non-blocking, event-driven servers like typical websites and backend API services.

### MERN Stack
it is used by developers worldwide. The main purpose of using MERN stack is to develop apps using JavaScript only. This is because the four technologies that make up the technology stack are all JS-based. Thus, if one knows JavaScript (and JSON), the backend, frontend, and database can be operated easily.

### PostgreSql
PostgreSQL is used as the primary data store or data warehouse for many web, mobile, geospatial, and analytics applications. 


### POSTMAN

Postman is an API(application programming interface) development tool which helps to build, test and modify APIs. Almost any functionality that could be needed by any developer is encapsulated in this tool. It is used by over 5 million developers every month to make their API development easy and simple.
